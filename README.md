## Hello, I'm Logan Wiggins

I am a senior at Florida State University pursuing a bachelor's degree in Information Technology with a minor in Computer Science, set to graduate in May 2024. Motivated to leverage my computer skills, I am passionate about discovering innovative solutions through software development. Currently, I'm honing my abilities through an internship at Paul Consulting Group, university courses, and personal projects, preparing for full-time career opportunities in software development and engineering following my graduation. 

As a driven entry-level software developer, I love conceptualizing and taking on personal programming projects like my personal website and my integer conversion application, for example.
