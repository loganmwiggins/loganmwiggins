<!-- About -->
<p>
I am a recent graduate of Florida State University, holding a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology with a minor in Computer Science. After graduating Summa Cum Laude, I am eager to continue to apply my skills and knowledge in software development to real-world challenges and opportunities. Throughout my time at FSU, I honed my professional skills through internships, jobs, coursework, and personal projects, preparing myself for a successful career in software development and engineering. I am passionate about leveraging technology to drive innovation and create impactful solutions. In my new role as a software engineer at JM Family Enterprises on the Southeast Toyota Finance team, I am excited to explore new opportunities and contribute to the professional world with enthusiasm and dedication.
<br>
<br>
As a driven entry-level software developer, I like to conceptualize and take on personal programming projects like my <a href="https://www.loganwiggins.com">personal website</a> and my <a href="https://www.wigginsnet.com/int-convert">integer conversion application</a>, for example.
